## community service & event organization:

+  I am co-founder of the **UCL bioimage interest group** since September 2020, now <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lmcb/ucl-biig"> BIIG </a>. The interest group aims to connect users and experts from different backgrounds who are interested in biological and biomedical image acquisition and analysis. We hold monthly hybrid meetings, hosting two speakers for short and informal presentations each time. We welcome work-in-progress presentations and highly encourage the participation of early-career researchers.

  + As part of the efforts above I have also been involved in organising a yearly **image analysis hackday**, open to participants of all levels. In 2022 we were awarded a **eResearch award** for collaborative initiatives grant to fund the event, which has since then been generously supported by UCL ARC and a UCL FLS fund.

+ Member of the **LMCB Postdoc committee** since 2020, involved in organizing workshops focused on postdoctoral and PI fellowships (2021 and 2024). 

+ Together with a colleague, I manage the **LMCB microfabrication facility**, for which I am responsible for training users and maintaining equipment (spin coater, 3D printer and more).
