I am a postdoc in the Mao lab at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lmcb/">UCL Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology</a> (UK).

I received my PhD in Molecular Biology from <a href="https://www.embl.org">EMBL Heidelberg</a> (Germany).

Prior to this I completed a Bachelor in Physics and Master's in Applied Physics at the University of Bologna (Italy).
