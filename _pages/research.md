My current research focuses on [...]

During my PhD at EMBL in the Lemke group, I have focused on the nuclear import properties of large cargoes in cells. I developed a large cargo model system for nuclear transport studies based on virus-like particles, spanning the size range 18-36 nm and with a tunable amount of nuclear targeting signals exposed on their surface. By implementing an automated confocal imaging and image analysis pipeline I characterized the kinetics of nuclear import and the main factors affecting it. I complemented these experiments with higher resolution techniques, such as single-particle tracking and super-resolution microscopy to gain more details on the interaction between the cargoes and nuclear pore complexes. 

## Advanced labelling techniques 

My Master's thesis in Applied Physics (Supervisor: Prof. Remondini) was on statistical methods for the analysis of DNA sequences, with a particular focus on dinucleotide distribution in the human genome. Other Master's projects included TazBots and image analysis for microcalcification detection in mammograms. 

My Bachelor's thesis in Physics (Supervisor: Prof. Fantazzini) consisten in the characterization of an experimental setup for x-ray irradiation of cells in the low dose region.
