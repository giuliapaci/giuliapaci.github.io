I am an experimental biophysicist with a strong interest in the role of external perturbations during organism development and homeostasis. My current work focuses on investigating how **organisms develop robustly despite the presence of fluctuating external mechanical perturbations**, using Drosophila larvae as model organisms. To this end, I have developed a novel tool based on PDMS channels to confine and mechanically stimlate larvae in vivo, which I am using to screen the long-term effect of altered mechanical forces on development. I complement this with ex-vivo experiments combining high-resolution imaging and ex-vivo mechanical perturbations using a tissue stretcher, which enables the investigation of specific pathways of interest in real time. As a physicist by training, I enjoy **building new tools** that enable the control of key experimental parameters and allow me to explore how biological systems respond both within the physiological range and beyond.

I also have a long-standing passion for **microscopy and bioimage analysis**: during my postdoc I have contributed to testing and feature enhancement of <a href="https://github.com/epitools/epitools"> Epitools </a>, a napari plugin for epithelial tissue analysis. I have also led efforts to build and foster a community around bioimaging and image analysis at UCL and beyond through the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lmcb/ucl-biig"> UCL Bioimage Interest Group </a> and more (see "service").

## PhD research

During my PhD at EMBL in the Lemke group, I have focused on the nuclear import properties of large cargoes in cells. I developed a **large cargo model system** for nuclear transport studies based on engineered virus-like particles, spanning the size range 18-36 nm and with tunable surface properties (number of nuclear localisation sequences, surface charge and hydrophobicity). By implementing an automated confocal imaging and image analysis pipeline I characterized the kinetics of nuclear import and the main factors affecting it. I complemented these experiments with higher resolution techniques, such as single-particle tracking and super-resolution microscopy to gain a more detailed understanding of the interaction between the cargoes and nuclear pore complexes. 

Alongside my main PhD research project I was also involved in collaborations to develop **advanced labelling techniques** based on genetic code expansion to introduce minimal tags with site-specific targeting in a protein of interest sequence. 


## Previous projects

My Master's thesis in Applied Physics (Supervisor: Prof. Remondini) was on statistical methods for the analysis of DNA sequences, with a particular focus on dinucleotide distribution in the human genome. Other Master's projects included "TazBots", a group project where we implemented a C++ agent-based model of a small ecosystem. We simulated a 2D environment where animals move, eat and interact with each other (biting), inspired by Tasmanian Devils and the challenge of Tasmanian Devil facial tumour disease, one of the few examples of a transmissible tumor. 
Another Master's project was focused on a comparison of machine-learning and graph-based image analysis methods for the detection of microcalcification in mammograms. 

My Bachelor's thesis in Physics (Supervisor: Prof. Fantazzini) consisted in the characterization of an experimental setup for X-ray irradiation of cells in the low dose region.
