Between 2020 and 2022 I was a Volunteer at the London Science Museum in the <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/medicine-wellcome-galleries"> Medicine Galleries </a>. I led mini-tours focused on medical imaging (mostly MRI and microscopy).

Some of my favourite objects & stories from the gallery are one of the very first Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) body scanners, made by Sir Peter Mansfield and his team of physicists in 1978 and the Jedi helmets which were also featured in a  <a href="https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/stories-from-the-stores/"> Stories from the Store </a> episode.
