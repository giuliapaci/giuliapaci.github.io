In 2018-2019 I was involved in developing the <a href="https://www.embl.org/ells/microscope-in-action/"> Microscope in Action </a> educational resource.

We published the MiA resource on The Biophysicist, a peer-reviewed journal covering biophysics education research as well as evidence-based pedagogical practices {% cite paci2021microscope %}.
